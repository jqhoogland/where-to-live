# Where to live?

There are other places to live besides SF and Austin. I'd like to find out where they are.

Inspired by XKCD's:
![temperature preferences](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/temperature_preferences_2x.png)

I want similar plots for other interesting metrics: 
- Climate resilience,
- Size of the city,
- Affordability,
- Access to nature,
- etc.

And a lookup tool. And maybe a suggestion tool (once you've weighted all the metrics accordingly).

### Todo's
- First: recreate XKCD's graph.
